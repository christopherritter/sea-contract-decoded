<section prefix="a">The Springboro Community School District believes that staff evaluation is an ongoing process. Evaluations are used to improve the quality of instruction, to enhance job performance responsibilities and to focus on and emphasize professional development. Effective student learning is the ultimate goal of evaluations. It is a continuous, constructive and cooperative process wherein the individual being evaluated and the evaluator share a join responsibility to work together to recognize effective instructions and the means and methods by which to improve student learning. It is a process meant to commend where commendation is warranted and create specific professional developmental plans and suggest means of improvement when needed. It is also a means for making decisions regarding employment.</section>
