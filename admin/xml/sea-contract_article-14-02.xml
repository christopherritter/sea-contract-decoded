<text>
<section prefix="a">Employees who exhaust all sick leave they have earned or have had credited to their account as an advance or from the sick leave bank who remain sick and unable to report for work shall automatically, for up to thirty (30) days, be deemed on leave-without-pay status. During this thirty (30) day period, the employee MUST apply for appropriate leave to cover the absence from work. Failure to properly apply for appropriate leave during this thirty (30) day period is grounds for termination of the employee's contract for willful failure to return to work.</section>
