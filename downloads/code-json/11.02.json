The employee shall have the opportunity for a conference with the Superintendent to discuss the reasons for the non-renewal recommendation. In the event the Superintendent\u2019s reasons for non-renewal are not disclosed in the employee\u2019s written evaluation record, such reasons shall have been properly documented as required by the provisions of this Agreement. (See Article VII, Section 7.03.)\r\re The Superintendent shall recommend and the BOARD shall act on a non-renewal recommendation prior to April 30 of the year in which the employee\u2019s contract expires.\r\rf Within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the BOARD\u2019s written notice of non-renewal, the employee may request in the writing to the Treasurer of the BOARD a hearing with the BOARD regarding the contract non-renewal. Said employee shall be notified within ten (10) calendar days of the time, date, and place of the hearing which shall be within thirty (30) calendar days of the request.\r\rh The BOARD shall issue a written decision and order to the employee within (10) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing either affirming or vacating the BOARD\u2019s action of non-renewal. Should the BOARD vacate the non-renewal, all reference to said non-renewal shall be expunged from the employee\u2019s record.\r\ri The employee shall have the right to representation by the ASSOCIATION at each step of this procedure.\r\rj Upon completion of the procedures set forth in this Article, the employee may use the grievance-arbitration procedures in this Agreement to grieve procedural but not substantive\/merit issues, with the arbitrator having the authority in an appropriate case to remedy procedural errors only.\r\r","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"12","name":"Discipline -
