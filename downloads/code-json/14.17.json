Employees who: (1) have been continuously employed for at least one (1) year;\nand (2) have either: (a) worked for at least 1250 hours during the twelve (12)\nmonth period immediately preceding the date when the application to take this\nleave is filed, or (b) were employed under a \u201cfull time\u201d contract during the\ntwelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date when the application to\ntake this leave is filed, shall be eligible for \u201cFamily and Medical Leave\u201d\nin accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act, Public Law 103-3.\n\nb. Family and Medical Leave may be taken by employees who are temporarily unable\nto work due to:\n\n1. birth of a child where the employee is needed to care for such newborn [Child\nCare Leave, see Section 14.06];\n\n2. placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care [Adoption\nLeave, see Section 14.07];\n\n3. the need for the employee to care for the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter\nor parent with a serious health condition [Family Care Leave]; or\n\n4. serious health conditions of the employee, as defined by the U.S. Department\nof Labor\u2019s Regulations, that make the employee unable to perform essential\nfunctions of his\/her job (with or without reasonable accommodations for the\ndisability, if such is required) [employee disability leave]\n\nc. Child Leave and Adoption Leave taken under this section as Family and Medical\nLeave may commence at any time during the one (1) year period following the date\nof birth or date of placement for adoption.\n\nd. No more than twelve (12) weeks of Family and Medical Leave, as such, will be\ngranted in any twelve (12) month period commencing with the first day of usage.\n\ne. In the event both a husband and a wife are employed by the BOARD, the\ncombined total Family and Medical Leave which can be granted as Child Care Leave\nor Adoption Leave is twelve (12) weeks in any one (1) year period.\n\nf. Where the necessity for this leave is foreseeable, the employee must give\nnotice by requesting this Leave, in writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to\nthe onset of the leave. Such written notice shall be filed with the\nSuperintendent. In those situations where the employee is unable to give this\nthirty (30) day notice, notice of the request for the leave must be given at the\nearliest time possible, considering all the circumstances present.\n\nWhen \u201cfamily care leave\u201d or employee disability leave\u201d is forseeable,\nbased on planned medical treatment, the employee should try to schedule such\nplanned medical treatment during non-assigned duty time.\n\ng. Requests for \u201cfamily care leave\u201d must be supported by a health care\nprovider certification verifying that a serious health condition exists and that\nthe employee is needed to care for the family member and the estimated time\nneeded for such care.\n\nRequests for \u201cemployee disability leave\u201d must be supported by a health care\nprovider certification verifying that a serious health condition exists and a\nstatement that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of\nhis\/her position.\n\nRequests for \u201cintermittent or reduced schedule family care leave\u201d or\n\u201creduced schedule employee disability leave\u201d must be further supported by\nmedical certification as to the necessary and the expected duration of the\nleave; and, for planned medical treatments, the dates and duration of each\ntreatment.\n\nh. Employees covered by the medical insurance program set form in Article XVIII,\nSection 10.02(a), at the onset of a leave secured under this section may\ncontinue to participate in the program during the leave on the same terms and\nconditions that would have applied had no leave been taken. The premium portion\npayable by the employee, is any, is due on the first day of the month.\n\ni. Except as specifically required by other provisions of the AGREEMENT with\nrespect to any other type of leave taken concurrently with leave taken under\nthis Section, no other employment benefits accrue during a family and medical\nleave and no other paid leave benefits will be paid if such occur during a\nfamily and medical leave. The seniority of an employee on a approved family\nmedical leave of absence shall not be broken, and the time spent on such leave\nshall be continued as continuous service for seniority calculation purpose.\n\nj. Where there is medical necessary for :intermittent leave\u201d or \u201creduced\nschedule leave\u201d or \u201cfamily care leave\u201d or \u201cemployee disability leave,\u201d\nsuch are available, subject to agreement between the BOARD and the employee.\nHowever, the BOARD may require the employee to transfer for during of the leave\nto an equivalent position that better accommodates the purposed intermittent or\nreduced leave schedule, if such a position exists within the employee\u2019s\narea(s) of certification. Employee\u2019s on an intermittent or reduced leave\nschedule will have their salaries reduced to reflect the hours or days missed\ndue to such leave unless paid leave (e.g., sick leave) is otherwise payable for\ntime off work on Family and Medical Leave under other provisions of this\nAGREEMENT.\n\nk. Employees with accrued but unusued personal days or sick leave days must use\nsuch paid leave first as part of any \u201cfamily care leave\u201d and\/or \u201cemployee\ndisability leave\u201d taken under this Section.
