Initial membership will consist of one (1) day sick leave, to be deducted from the employee\u2019s sick leave accumulation and be transferred to the S.L.B. prior to October 1. Each employee will receive a notice of receipt indicated his\/her participation in the program. Any unused days in the Bank will carry over to the next year.\r\r3 Membership shall be continuous unless canceled, in writing, to the Treasurer\u2019s Office during the period of September 1 through October 1.\r\r4 If 50 participants are not enrolled by October 1st, the bank will not be established for that school year.\r\rc Operational Procedures:\r\r1 Loans will be limited to participating employees for use only in cases of the employee\u2019s own, the employee\u2019s spouse or dependent child\u2019s personal illness, injury or non-elective surgery occurrence under unusual, severe or emergency conditions, as determined by the S.L.B. Board.

A Physician\u2019s Statement (Appendix C) is required with each application in order to be considered for a loan.\r\r3 A loan will be considered only after the individual has used all of his\/her accumulated sick leave days, has used all possible advances of sick leave days and is not eligible for disability leave under the Ohio State Teacher Retirement System.\r\rd Sick Leave Bank Board\r\r The Sick Leave Loan Bank is to be regulated by a Board consisting of two (2) teachers to be selected by the ASSOCIATION, one of whom will be co-chairman and a permanent member; and two (2) administrators to be selected by the Superintendent, one of whom shall be a co-chairman and a permanent member. A physical shall be asked to volunteer as an advisor to the Board, as needed. One (1) employee and one (1) administrator shall be appointed to three (3) year terms.\r\re Loan and Payback Procedures\r\r1 The maximum number of days that a member may borrow is ten percent (10%) of the total days in the bank at the end of the enrollment period (October 1).\r\r2 The member who borrows days will pay back the days at the rate of fifty percent (50%) of his\/her annual accumulated sick leave at the and of the salary contract year, each year until the total number of days borrowed has been restored to the bank. Provided, int he event of a member who owes days to the bank ceases for any reason to earn sick leave days (i.e., retirement, resignation, permanent disability or death), any days of sick leave at that time to the credit of such member after first repaying days and advanced shall be used to repay the bank before any sick leave days are cashed in for severance pay purposes.\r\rf Policy Procedures:\r\r1 In consideration of the benefits of participating in the S.L.B., each applicant of membership in the Bank and for benefits from the Bank shall, as a condition to such application, agree in writing as follows \u201cI specifically acknowledge and agree that the granting of days from the S.L.B. shall be at the sole discretion of the S.L.B. Board. All decisions of the S.L.B. Board will be final and binding and are not subject to grievance. I further agree to abide by such decision and to indemnify and hold harmless the Springboro Community City School District, the Springboro Education Association, the S.L.B. Board, and al of their agents for any loss they may sustain as a result of any claim or legal proceedings I may bring against any of them respect to a decision made by any of them concerning this application.\u201d\r\r2 Application for the S.L.B. days must be made to the Superintendent.\r\r3 The S.L.B. Board shall meet and render a decision within ten (10) days of receipt of request.\r\r4 Unused requested days shall be returned to the S.L.B.\r\r5 The S.L.B. will begin with one (1) day from each contributing employee. When the fund is depleted below seventy-five (75) days, each member will be assessed one (1) additional day. The S.L.B. Board shall be responsible for notifying employees of each assessment period. Members may donate days above and beyond this requirement.\r\r6 Extension of additional days may be applied for in the same manner as original application.\r\r7 When an employee donates days to the Bank, he\/she agrees to the above stated rules for administration of the Bank and agrees to abide by the stated rules.\r\r8 All decisions of the S.L.B.
