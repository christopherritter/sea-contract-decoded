<section prefix="a">In the event that full tentative agreement is not reached at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the expiration (or reopener, if applicable) date specified in the AGREEMENT, the parties mutually agree to utilize the services of a Mediator designated by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. So that a Mediator can be promptly designated and be of assistance to the parties when needed, the parties will no later than seventy (70) calendar days prior to the expiration (or reopener, if applicable) date write the appropriate District Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service requesting the designation of a Mediator who could be utilized, if necessary. Either party may request the services of a Mediator at any time during the sixty (60) calendar day period prior to the expiration (or reopener, if applicable) date whether or not an impasse in negotiations exist. However, if full agreement has not been reached at least forty-five (45) calendar days before the expiration (or reopener, if applicable) date, the services of a Mediator shall be utilized.</section>

<section prefix="b">The dispute resolution procedure shall be deemed exhausted either:</section>

<section prefix="1">at the expiration of the AGREEMENT; or</section>

<section prefix="2">if the AGREEMENT is extended, when either party declares that mediation was unable to result in a settlement. In the case of a contract reopener, the dispute resolution procedures shall be deemed to be exhausted forty-five (45) calendar days after mediation services are initiated unless the parties extend this process for a longer period of time.</section>
