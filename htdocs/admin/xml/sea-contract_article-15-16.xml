<section prefix="a">Purpose</section>

<section>The BOARD and the ASSOCIATION agree that quality education is not possible in an environment affected by illegal drug use and/or abuse of alcoholic beverages. The BOARD and ASSOCIATION have established and agree to maintain a drug/alcohol-free educational setting in full compliance with federal, state, and local laws, including the Drug-Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act.</section>

<section prefix="b">Employee Assistance Program</section>

<section>Chemically dependent employees are urged to seek help before their dependence causes problems with their jobs.</section>

<section>Recognizing that chemical dependency is a treatable illness which should be dealt with by treatment and education, it is they BOARDâ€˜s policy to prevent chemical dependency and/or offer rehabilitation, rather than to merely discipline employees for substance abuse related problems. To that end, the BOARD and the ASSOCIATION have formed an Employee Assistance Committee consisting of at least one representative from Administration, the SEA bargaining unit, the SCEA bargaining unit, and that group of employees not represented by either SEA or SCEA, to monitor the Employee Assistance Program which is available to all BOARD employees and their dependents.</section>


<section>The Administration will work with an employee desiring chemical dependency rehabilitation assistance on a voluntary basis. Applicable group health plan coverages, sick leave benefits and leaves of absence policies are available to assist employees who seek rehabilitation. Voluntary rehabilitation and/or inquiries concerning rehabilitation will not be used as evidence of a violation of any BOARD policy.</section>

<section>Where rehabilitation is offered by the Administration in lieu of discipline, such rehabilitation, if elected, is considered involuntary. Involuntary rehabilitation shall be available only one (1)time during an employees tenure of employment with the BOARD, and shall not be available to any employee in lieu of termination for operating any motor vehicle on BOARD business under the influence of alcoholic beverages, or while currently using illegal drugs.</section>

<section prefix="c">Drug-Free Awareness Program</section>

<section>The Employee Assistance Program referenced in this section will include educational opportunities for employees to obtain information on the dangers of substance abuse and resources available for chemical dependency and rehabilitation. in the meantime, information on drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation resources, and re-entry programs, and benefits available to employees in dealing with substance abuse problems will be maintained in the District.</section>

<section prefix="d">Drug Testing</section>

<section>Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring an employee to submit to urinalysis tests for controlled substances; however, it is understood that the Administration may require such tests to the extent testing is required by federal or state law. In the event such testing is required, the parties will meet and confer regarding the facility or facilities to be used to perform such tests.</section>

<section prefix="e">Confidentiality</section>

<section>Information provided to administrative personnel concerning medical problems related to substance abuse or chemical dependency of an employee shall be considered part of the employees medical record and shall be treated as confidential. However, performance problems, attendance or rules violations will be documented, reported or otherwise treated as ordinary personnel information even if related to substance abuse or chemical dependency.</section>
