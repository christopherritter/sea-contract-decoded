<section prefix="b">Step Two: Written to Administrator</section>

<section prefix="1">If the discussion does not resolve the grievance to the satisfaction of the grievant, such grievant shall have the right to file a written grievance with the appropriate Administrator. If such grievance is not filed within twenty (20) calendar days after the occurrence of the act or the condition which is the basis of said grievance, said grievance shall be waived. The written grievance shall be on standard form (Appendix A) and shall contain a concise statement of the facts upon which the grievance is based and a reference to the specific provision of this Agreement allegedly violated, misinterpreted or misapplied.</section>

When issued in accordance with these procedures, the opinion and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, or modify this Agreement. The arbitrator has the authority to determine arbitrability if such an issue exists.
