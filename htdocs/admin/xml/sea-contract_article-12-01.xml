<section prefix="a">Seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous full or part-time service as an employee in the bargaining unit under a limited or continuing contract in the district.</section>

<section prefix="b">The accrual of seniority shall begin from the date of regular full-time or part-time employment as verified by official Board of Education minutes, and continue for all time the employee is working and receiving regular paychecks, is receiving Workersâ€˜ Compensation benefits, or is in military service.</section>

<section prefix="c">Time spent on inactive pay status of one or more years, after September 1, 1992 (unpaid leave, suspended contract, or the initial five years of disability retirement), shall not contribute to the accrual of seniority, but shall not constitute a break in seniority. Such employees will be given an adjusted seniority date to reflect the time off work on such unpaid leave, suspended contract, or disability retirement.</section>

<section prefix="d">Seniority shall be terminated when an employee resigns, retires, or his/her contract with the BOARD is terminated or is non-renewed.</section>

<section prefix="e">if two or more employees have the same seniority or adjusted seniority date, as computed using the foregoing procedures, or if conflicts develop over seniority, seniority will be first determined by the date of Board of Education hiring as stated in the BOARD minutes; secondly by the date of employment application, and thirdly by a coin flip by those involved in the dispute.</section>
