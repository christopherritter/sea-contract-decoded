<catch_line>School Discipline Procedures</catch_line>
	
<text>(a) The BOARD is responsible for adopting a code of student conduct.

(b) The Principal of each building shall develop with his/her faculty and staff a means of implementing the adopted code of a student conduct for his/her school building that leads to appropriate student discipline.

(c) Rules and regulations governing discipline and procedures for student control shall be reviewed by the Building Principal periodically with the faculty.

(d) A Building Code of Conduct regarding discipline shall be presented to each employee at the beginning of each school year.

13.02 Assault

(a) An employee who has been physically or verbally assaulted shall make an immediate oral report to the Principal or his designee. The employee shall make a complete written report of the incident to the Principal as soon as physically able to do so.

(b) The Principal shall give a full report to the Superintendent who shall determine if any public authority should be contacted by the District and/or if proceedings should be initiated by the District against the assailant. Nothing in this section prohibits the employee from personally initiating legal action; provided, however, prior to doing so the Superintendent must be notified.

(c) If court action results from action taken by the Superintendent (as opposed to civil action initiated by the employee for his/her own benefit) the employee shall be granted leave of absence with no loss of pay for the days in court or consultation as may be requested by BOARD counsel, the County Prosecutor, the Court, or law enforcement officers.

(d) Any employee who is disabled and unable to perform his/her duties due to an assault upon the employee as certified by the employee's attending physician to the Superintendent, in writing, shall receive leave up to a maximum of seventeen (17) work days. Upon request from the Superintendent, the employee may be required to be examined by a BOARD-designated physician to verify such disability.

(e) In the event the employee's physician and the physician selected by the Superintendent do not agree on any matter, they shall jointly refer the matter to a third physician mutually acceptable to such physicians who shall consider the reports of the two physicians, examine the employee, if necessary, and determine the matter at issue. The determination of this third physician shall be binding on all concerned and is not subject to further appeal.

The employee is responsible for all expenses incurred from his/her physician.

The BOARD is responsible for all expenses incurred from the physician selected by the Superintendent and for the cost of the third physician.

13.03 Accident Reports

(a) In the case of accidents involving students under an employee's supervision, an accident report shall be filed with the Building Principal; provided, however, the BOARD shall have the right to waive this requirement and in lieu thereof to require the employee to submit a confidential report of the incident to the BOARD‘s attorney, which report shall be protected by the attorney-client privilege, by the employee no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the incident.

(b) Non-confidential reports shall be in writing and provided to the employee's immediate supervisor.

(c) The employee shall have the right to ASSOCIATION representation in any meeting involving representatives of the District.

(d) If a liability suit against the employee arises out of the accident, the District shall provide the employee with counsel and will hold the employee harmless to the full extent required by the applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised Code. If criminal charges against the employee arise out of, or in the opinion of the BOARD‘s attorney may arise out of, the accident, the BOARD may, but shall not be required to, provide the employee with counsel in such criminal action proceedings, as the BOARD in the exercise of its sole discretion shall determine.</text>
