{"section_number":"15.16","section_id":"99","structure_id":"16","catch_line":"Drug\/Alcohol Free Schools","history":"","full_text":"a Purpose\n\nThe BOARD and the ASSOCIATION agree that quality education is not possible in an environment affected by illegal drug use and\/or abuse of alcoholic beverages. The BOARD and ASSOCIATION have established and agree to maintain a drug\/alcohol-free educational setting in full compliance with federal, state, and local laws, including the Drug-Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act.\r\rb Employee Assistance Program\n\nChemically dependent employees are urged to seek help before their dependence causes problems with their jobs.\n\nRecognizing that chemical dependency is a treatable illness which should be dealt with by treatment and education, it is they BOARD\u2018s policy to prevent chemical dependency and\/or offer rehabilitation, rather than to merely discipline employees for substance abuse related problems. To that end, the BOARD and the ASSOCIATION have formed an Employee Assistance Committee consisting of at least one representative from Administration, the SEA bargaining unit, the SCEA bargaining unit, and that group of employees not represented by either SEA or SCEA, to monitor the Employee Assistance Program which is available to all BOARD employees and their dependents.\n\nThe Administration will work with an employee desiring chemical dependency rehabilitation assistance on a voluntary basis. Applicable group health plan coverages, sick leave benefits and leaves of absence policies are available to assist employees who seek rehabilitation. Voluntary rehabilitation and\/or inquiries concerning rehabilitation will not be used as evidence of a violation of any BOARD policy.\n\nWhere rehabilitation is offered by the Administration in lieu of discipline, such rehabilitation, if elected, is considered involuntary. Involuntary rehabilitation shall be available only one (1)time during an employees tenure of employment with the BOARD, and shall not be available to any employee in lieu of termination for operating any motor vehicle on BOARD business under the influence of alcoholic beverages, or while currently using illegal drugs.\r\rc Drug-Free Awareness Program\n\nThe Employee Assistance Program referenced in this section will include educational opportunities for employees to obtain information on the dangers of substance abuse and resources available for chemical dependency and rehabilitation. in the meantime, information on drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation resources, and re-entry programs, and benefits available to employees in dealing with substance abuse problems will be maintained in the District.\r\rd Drug Testing\n\nNothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring an employee to submit to urinalysis tests for controlled substances; however, it is understood that the Administration may require such tests to the extent testing is required by federal or state law. In the event such testing is required, the parties will meet and confer regarding the facility or facilities to be used to perform such tests.\r\re Confidentiality\n\nInformation provided to administrative personnel concerning medical problems related to substance abuse or chemical dependency of an employee shall be considered part of the employees medical record and shall be treated as confidential. However, performance problems, attendance or rules violations will be documented, reported or otherwise treated as ordinary personnel information even if related to substance abuse or chemical dependency.\r\rf Notification\n\nAt the beginning of each school year, all employees will receive a copy of the Drug\/Alcohol Policy which includes the disciplinary sanctions and a description of the Employee Assistance Program. The annual review of this section of BOARD Policy will emphasize that compliance is mandatory.\r\rg Board Policies\n\nThe BOARD may adopt policies, rules and procedures to implement the terms of this Section.\r\rh Prohibited Conduct\n\nThe unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use, or being under the influence of alcoholic beverages and\/or controlled substances (illegal drugs) by any employee, during working hours, on BOARD premises, or at any activity or function sponsored by or related to employment with the BOARD, is prohibited. \u201cPremises\u201d includes vehicles owned by, or being driven on behalf of the Springboro Community City School District, as well as parking lots, playgrounds, and other property owned by Springboro Community City Schools. \u201cControlled substance\u201d refers to drugs subject to federal or state regulation, making their manufacture, dispensation, distribution, possession or use a crime, this includes but is not limited to Cannabis, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Barbiturates, and Heroine. Medications used as prescribed by a treating physician or dentist are excluded.\r\ri Drug-Related Criminal Conviction\n\nEmployees convicted (including a guilty or no contest plea) of violating any federal, state or local criminal drug law, where the violation occurred during work hours, or on BOARD premises, must report the conviction to the Superintendent within five (5) business days of a conviction, Where said criminal offense is a minor misdemeanor, the employee shall be referred for involuntary rehabilitation in lieu of a 5-day suspension without pay. Failure to participate in rehabilitation or a subsequent conviction for minor misdemeanor drug-related offenses will result in a 5-day suspension without pay. Convictions for offenses other than minor misdemeanors will result in discipline, up to and including termination, in accordance with contractual and statutory provisions. Failure to report the conviction(s) will result in termination.\r\rj Penalties\n\nViolations of the BOARD\u2019s Drug\/Alcohol-Free Schools Policy will result in discipline up to and including termination, which disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with contractual and\/or statutory provisions.\r\r","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"16","name":"Working
