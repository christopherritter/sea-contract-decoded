{"section_number":"4.04","section_id":"21","structure_id":"5","catch_line":"Grievance Procedure","history":"","full_text":"a Step One: Discussion with Administrator\r\r1 Any employee having a grievance should first discuss such grievance and identify that he\/she is beginning the grievance procedure with the appropriate Administrator.\r\rb Step Two: Written to Administrator\r\r1 If the discussion does not resolve the grievance to the satisfaction of the grievant, such grievant shall have the right to file a written grievance with the appropriate Administrator. If such grievance is not filed within twenty (20) calendar days after the occurrence of the act or the condition which is the basis of said grievance, said grievance shall be waived. The written grievance shall be on standard form (Appendix A) and shall contain a concise statement of the facts upon which the grievance is based and a reference to the specific provision of this Agreement allegedly violated, misinterpreted or misapplied.\r\r2 Within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance, the Principal or Administrator shall hold a meeting at a mutually agreeable time to discuss the grievance.\r\r3 The Administrator shall answer the written grievance within seven (7) calendar days after the conclusion of the meeting. The answer and the reasons for the answer shall be reduced to writing and copies sent to the grievant, and the ASSOCIATION. In the event the Administrator fails to timely answer the grievance at Step 2, the grievant may move to the next step.\r\rc Step Three: Appeal to Superintendent\r\r1 If the answer of the Administrator does not resolve the grievance to the satisfaction of the grievant, the grievant may appeal the grievance in writing to the Superintendent. Failure to file such an appeal within seven (7) calendar days from receipt of the written Step Two answer of the Administrator shall be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal and the grievance shall thereafter be void and not subject to further processing. A meeting shall be conducted by the Superintendent, at a mutually agreeable time, within seven (7) calendar days after the receipt of the appeal. The grievant shall be advised in writing of the time, place and date of such hearing and shall have the right to be represented at such meeting by the ASSOCIATION.\r\r2 The Superintendent shall answer the appeal of the grievance within seven (7) calendar days after the conclusion of the Step Three meeting. The Step Three action and the reasons for the answer shall be reduced to writing and copies sent to the grievant, the Step One Administrator, and the ASSOCIATION. In the event the Superintendent fails to timely answer the grievance at Step Two the grievant may move to the next step.\r\re Step Four: Arbitration\r\r1 The ASSOCIATION may, within ten (10) calendar days after the issuance of the Step Three answer, demand arbitration in accordance with the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association; provided, however, it does not have the right to appoint an arbitrator who is not mutually agreeable to the parties. When issued in accordance with these procedures, the opinion and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, or modify this Agreement. The arbitrator has the authority to determine arbitrability if such an issue exists. Cost for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses and actual and necessary travel expense, shall be borne equality by the parties.\r\r","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"5","name":"Grievance
