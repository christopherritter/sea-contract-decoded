{"section_number":"14.10","section_id":"76","structure_id":"15","catch_line":"Job Sharing","history":"","full_text":"a An employee who has at least three (3) years of seniority is eligible to apply for and be granted a shared teaching assignment pursuant to the conditions set forth in this program agreement.\r\rb Two employees who are certified for the same position may be granted, upon the approval of the Superintendent in the exercise of his sole discretion, the opportunity to share a single full-time job assignment. Decisions of the Superintendent with regards to granting or not granting any application forjob sharing by any employees shall not be subject to review by the Board or be the subject of any grievance under the Grievance Procedure set forth in the basic Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Board and the SEA.\r\rc Employees who wish to share an assignment shall submit a written application to the Superintendent which includes a plan for approval to the Superintendent no later than March 1 of the year preceding the proposed job share plan. The plan must include the following elements:\r\r1 The names of the employees who desire to job share.\r\r The then current job assignments of such employees \u2013 building, grade, subject, team members if a team teaching situation, and all other relevant particulars of such assignment.\r\r The teaching assignment proposed for the job sharing \u2013 building, grade, subject matter, team members if a team teaching situation, and all relevant particulars of such assignment.\r\r A statement from each Building Principal affected if the shared staff or program which is proposed is approved, indicating the position of each regarding the effect of approving shared staffing on the educational opportunity for students.\r\r A statement from each team member affected if the shared staffing program which is proposed is approved, indicating the position of each regarding the effect of approving the shared staffing proposal on the educational opportunity for students.\r\r2 That the plan shall be in effect for one (1) school year.\r\r3 A full description of the teaching techniques, methods and grading practices used by each employee, with a full explanation of the steps the participants will use to insure compatibility of such techniques and practices.\r\r4 A full description as to who shall be responsible for teaching the specific areas of the curriculum, how grades and reports shall be completed, a means for communication between both employees and the Building administration.\r\rd A job sharing arrangement shall be for one (1) year increments and must receive the Superintendents approval for continuation from year to year.\r\re Should an employee, both employees or the Superintendent wish to discontinue the job sharing assignment for a subsequent school year, the employee with the greater seniority shall retain the position on a full-time basis. The employee with the less seniority shall be allowed to transfer to an open position, if any, and if there is no open position, shall be placed on a suspended contract basis due to a reduction-in~force and thereafter be permitted to exercise the rights available to an employee on reduction-in-force under the applicable provisions of the basic Collective Bargaining Agreement.\r\rf Both employees shall be present for Parent-Teacher conferences.\r\rg If during the course of the school year one employee is not able to continue in the job sharing assignment, the other employee must assume the full-time teaching position.\r\rh Each employee shall receive a prorated salary based upon the portion of the total employee duty day worked by each employee applied to the appropriate step on the salary schedule for each employee and for the amount of time that he\/she is assigned to work.\r\ri Sick leave earned prior to working in a job sharing assignment or while working in thejob sharing assignment shall be earned and used based on the concept that a day is a day.\r\rj If one job sharing employee is absent, the other employee may substitute for him\/her and will receive his\/her full daily rate of pay for such days.\r\rk The Board shall pay a total of 100% of a single or family monthly premium for the Board\u2019s portion of the premium cost for physician\/surgical and major medical, dental, vision and prescription drug benefit program as specified for a full-time employee in Article XVIII of the basic Collective Bargaining Agreement. If both employees desire coverage under such insurance programs, they shall, as part of their application, agree on the insurance program cost each shall be responsible for paying so that the total dollars payable by the Board will not exceed the amount the Board would have been required to pay for one full-time teaching employee.\r\r All particulars regarding the insurance coverage to be in effect for the employees involved in the job sharing must be worked out and agreed to in advance by the employees, the ASSOCIATION, and the Superintendent.\r\r If during the job sharing year the circumstances of either of the employees change and the opportunity to secure insurance coverage becomes necessary and is available, all concerned shall meet and work out the particulars to permit the insurance coverage to be provided at no additional total cost to the BOARD.\r\rl The total amount of personal leave the employees involved in sharing a single assignment shall be eligible to receive is three (3) one\u00bbhalf (1\/1) days each.\r\rm It is specifically understood and agreed that the Superintendent will not approve any request for a shared teaching assignment unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that approval of the application will benefit the educational opportunity for the students affected by the shared staffing if the application is approved.\r\r","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"15","name":"Leaves of
