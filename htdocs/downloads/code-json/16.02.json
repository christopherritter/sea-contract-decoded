employees who have attained continuing contract status elsewhere, becomes eligible for continuing contract status at the expiration of his\/her current limited contract, the BOARD may enter into a continuing contract with that employee at the commencement of the School year after the expiration of the employee\u2019s limited contract after such employee becomes eligible, provided that:\r\r1 No employee shall have a right to a continuing contract unless such employee has given notice of his\/her desire to be considered for a continuing contract by December 1 of the school year proceeding the school year for which the employee desires the continuing contract.\r\rb During Term of Limited Contract\r\r If an employee, including an employee who has attained continuing contract status elsewhere, becomes eligible for continuing contract status before the expiration of his\/her current multi-year limited contract, the BOARD may enter into a continuing contract with that employee at the commencement of the school year after the employee becomes eligible; provided that:\r\r1 the employee notifies the Superintendent, in writing, prior to October first of the school year during which the employee will become eligible for a continuing contract that he\/she will be completing his\/her requirements and will be eligible for a continuing contract during the term of said limited contract;\r\r2 the employee meets all requirements for a continuing contract before the start of the new contract and evidence of such achievement is on file with the Superintendent prior to the start of the school year; and\r\r3 The Superintendent believes that such employee should be issued a continuing contract and so recommends to the Board.\r\rc Determinations of the Superintendent and\/or the BOARD under this section are not appealable under the Grievance\/Arbitration provisions of this AGREEMENT.\r\rd Should the employee fail to provide the written notice required by paragraph (a) (1), the Board may issue the employee a one year limited contract.\r\re The provisions of this Article specifically supersede the relevant portions of Ohio Revised Code section 3319.111 and any other conflicting section of the Ohio Revised Code.\r\r","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"17","name":"Individual Employee
