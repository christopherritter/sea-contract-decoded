                                     CONTRACT

EXHAUSTION OF SICK LEAVE (§ 14.02)

a. Employees who exhaust all sick leave they have earned or have had credited to
their account as an advance or from the sick leave bank who remain sick and
unable to report for work shall automatically, for up to thirty (30) days, be
deemed on leave-without-pay status. During this thirty (30) day period, the
employee MUST apply for appropriate leave to cover the absence from work.
Failure to properly apply for appropriate leave during this thirty (30) day
period is grounds for termination of the employee’s contract for willful
failure to return to work.
