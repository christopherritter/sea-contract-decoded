                                     CONTRACT

ACCIDENT REPORTS (§ 13.03)

a. In the case of accidents involving students under an employee’s
supervision, an accident report shall be filed with the Building Principal;
provided, however, the BOARD shall have the right to waive this requirement and
in lieu thereof to require the employee to submit a confidential report of the
incident to the BOARD‘s attorney, which report shall be protected by the
attorney-client privilege, by the employee no later than twenty-four (24) hours
after the incident.

b. Non-confidential reports shall be in writing and provided to the employee’s
immediate supervisor.

c. The employee shall have the right to ASSOCIATION representation in any
meeting involving representatives of the District.

d. If a liability suit against the employee arises out of the accident, the
District shall provide the employee with counsel and will hold the employee
harmless to the full extent required by the applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code. If criminal charges against the employee arise out of, or in the
opinion of the BOARD‘s attorney may arise out of, the accident, the BOARD may,
but shall not be required to, provide the employee with counsel in such criminal
action proceedings, as the BOARD in the exercise of its sole discretion shall
determine.
