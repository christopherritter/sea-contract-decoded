SUBSTITUTES (ยง 15.08)

a. Every effort shall be made to secure a substitute in the absence of an
employee.

b. If it becomes necessary to have an employee substitute for an absent
employee, the following selection procedure to determine which employee shall be
required to do so shall be followed:

1. Prior to the start of each school year, the employees in each building shall
be sun/eyed to determine which employees assigned to the building desire to
volunteer for substitute teaching duty during the school year. Employees who
indicate a desire to volunteer for such substitute teaching duty who are
available to do so during the period required will be assigned the substitute
teaching duty on a rotating basis.

2. If no volunteer is available for the substitute teaching duty, the Principal
shall have the right to require an available employee to perform the substitute
teaching duty. If more than one employee is available during the period,
assignments will be made on a rotating basis.

c. If an employee (other than an employee supervising a study period) is
required by the Administration to substitute for an absent employee by taking
the full or partial (at least one-half (1/2) of the class) class of such absent
employee, the employee will be paid Twenty Dollars ($20.00) per period for such
work as an add-to pay.

d. An employee who is entitled to additional compensation pursuant to the
provisions of this Section shall receive a verification of the substitute duty
performed from the Building Principal by receiving a copy of the payment request
form submitted to the Treasurers Office.
